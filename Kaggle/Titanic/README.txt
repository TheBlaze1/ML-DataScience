This model was developed as the part of competition called Titanic on Kaggle - link https://www.kaggle.com/competitions.
The model is trained using RandomForestClassifier as it seems to be the best option for this purpose,
however I would also like to test this dataset by using Deep-Learning neural networks to see if the results change a little.

To develop this model I have used Jupyter notebook, and added the appropiate comments to make it more understandable by others

Throughout the development I tried to use some learnt techniques of data analyse to make it easier for the ML model to learn the patterns
, however becase I am currently in the learning proccess, especially the data analyse - I belive that there is still some room for improvements in terms of data structire.
 

Libraries used:
- Sci-Kit learn
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Pickle

Developed in Anaconda virtual environement using Jupyter notebook as the IDE.
