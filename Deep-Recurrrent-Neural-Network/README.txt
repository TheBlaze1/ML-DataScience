This recurrent neral network was developed for stock price prediction.
There is also the h5 file which contains already trained model of RNN which showed good results without overfitting or underfitting.
Any futher experimantations led to overffiting the model.


Trained Model:
The trained model was trained on 75 epochs with 3 hidden layers and adam optimizer as well as the batch size equal to 32.
Experimantation with the epochs and batch size as well as the hidden layers led to overfitting/underfitting the model. 
Given code is not adjusted to the one that matches the most succesful trained model because some futher analyze and experimatation is still in place, 
although I believe there is little to none place left for any improvements to the trained model.
