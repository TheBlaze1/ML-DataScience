This Random Forest Classifier model was developed in the Jupyter Notebook and was developed as the part of the inlie course,
thats why there is some experimantations with the code. This ML model was developed to classify the heart disease for each of the patients.

The resluts are not as good as they could be - I belive that using data anylis this model can still be improved but as it is a part of the online course,
this notebook is more considered as the playground where some experimentation is being done using Sci-Kit learn library.
